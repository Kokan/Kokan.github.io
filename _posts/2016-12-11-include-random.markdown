# Formal education

## Mathematics
At the university I had a few class, which touched the topic about random, and I do not mean some pseudo-random, rather from the pure abstract mathematical point of view. We had our *fun* at that time.

## IT
Of course at computer science classes we had `random` number generator, or **did we** ?

I had an exam, where we must wrote multi-threaded application in Ada language. It was some kind of simple producer, consumer problem, the only part I was lacking to generate a random number. I have totally forgot how to do it in Ada, and we cannot use any manual or help for the exam. At that point either I could fail the whole exam, or cheat (That is something I disliked at university.)

In the end I came up with a rather error-prone random number generator:

```
  return 4;
```

At least it compiled, and I could finish the important part of the exam.

## `<random>`
This is a nice extension of the standard C++, while I can write code and still think I am a math person. You can watch a nice presentation about the library.
